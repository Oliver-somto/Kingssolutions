    <h2>WAEC</h2>
    <p>The West African Examinations Council (WAEC) is an examination board established by law to determine the examinations required in the public interest in the English-speaking West African countries, to conduct the examinations and to award certificates comparable to those of equivalent examining authorities internationally. Established in 1952, the council has contributed to education in Anglophone countries of West Africa (Ghana, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, Liberia, and the Gambia), with the number of examinations they have coordinated, and certificates they have issued. They also formed an endowment fund, to contribute to education in West Africa, through lectures and aid to those who cannot afford education. Since established it continues to be one of the biggest and most globally recognized exams in West Africa. Dr. Adeyegbe, former HNO of WAEC Nigeria (2004) said<em>the council has developed a team of well-trained and highly motivated staff, and has administered Examinations that are valid and relevant to the educational aspirations of member countries</em>. In a year, over three million candidates registered for the exams coordinated by WAEC. The council also helps other examination bodies (both local and international) in coordinating Examinations.</p>
    <h3>EXAMINATIONS CONDUCTED</h3>
    The council conducts four different categories of examinations. They are International Examinations, National Examinations, Examinations conducted in collaboration with other examining bodies, and Examinations conducted on behalf of other examining bodies. The International exams are exams taken in the five countries with the WAEC ordinance. It consists of: WASSCE (West African Senior School Certificate Examination):
    <ul>
      <li>WASSCE FOR PRIVATE CANDIDATES (FIRST SERIES) JANUARY–FEBRUARY</li>
      <li>WASSCE FOR (SCHOOL CANDIDATES) MARCH - MAY</li>
      <li>WASSCE FOR PRIVATE CANDIDATES (MAIN GCE) SEPTEMBER–OCTOBER</li>
      </ul>
    <p>The National examinations are taken in individual countries. They include:</p>
    <ul>
    <li>the Junior Secondary School Certificate for Nigeria and the Gambia,</li>
      <li>Junior and Senior High School Certificate Examinations for Liberia,</li>
      <li>National Primary School and Basic Education Certificate Examinations for Sierra Leone,</li>
      <li>Basic Education Certificate Examinations for Ghana, and
Senior School Certificate Examinations for Ghana.</li>
      </ul>
    <p>The council also coordinates examinations in collaboration with some trustworthy examination bodies. These include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>City and Guilds of London Institute</li>
      <li>Royal Society of Arts
WAEC Research Institute</li>
      </ul>
    <p>The council also conducts examination in West Africa on behalf of international examination bodies. These include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>University of London GCE</li>
      <li>Scholastic Aptitude Test and Graduate Record Examinations for Educational Testing Service, Princeton, USA, and</li>
      <li>JAMB (Joint Admissions and Matriculations Board) examination in countries outside Nigeria.</li>
      </ul>
The council issues credible and reliable certificates to candidates that participate in the Examinations. The standard of this certificates matches with that of the United Kingdom. This is because the WAEC Ordinance empowered the council to conduct Examinations and award certificates, provided the certificates dont have a lower standard compared to their equivalent certificates of examining authorities in the United Kingdom.

    <h2>NECO</h2>
    <p>The establishment of the National Examinations Council (NECO) in April 1999, is a culmination of reaction of the Federal Government to widespread escalating agitations for a national examination outfit that would be responsive to the Nigerian needs and demands as well as cope with the annually increasing number of secondary school candidates to take Senior School Certificate Examination (SSCE) nationwide. Series of panels had earlier been set up to address the issues before this vital decision was taken.</p>

    <p>The origin of the issues dates back to 1977, during the Murtala/Obasanjo administration, when there was a widespread leakage of West African School Certificate Examination WASSCE questions. The public outcry that greeted the mass leakage led the Federal Government to set up the Sogbetun commission of enquiry with specific mandate to look into the remote causes of the leakage and make appropriate recommendations to government. Key among the findings of the committee was that the workload of WAEC was beyond its capacity, hence, it was difficult for WAEC to effectively manage the conduct of a hitch-free examination. The Sogbetun commission recommended among other things, the establishment of additional examination bodies to reduce the workload of WAEC and make it more efficient.</p>
    <p><em>NECO was mandated to take over the responsibilities of the National Board of Education Measurement (NBEM). Its maiden examination took place in mid-2000.</em>

    <h2>NABTEB</h2>
    <p>The National Business and Technical Examinations Board was established in 1992 to domesticate craft level examinations which were hitherto conducted by City & Guilds, Pittman’s, and Royal Society of Arts all of UK in accordance with the provisions of the National Policy on Education. Its establishment was the climax of an evolutionary process which spanned 15 years from 1977 to 1992 and in which FOUR Government Panels at different times were set up to review the place and structure of public examinations in our educational system.</p>

      <p>Each of these Panels advocated and justified the multiplication of the examinations bodies, and in particular, a separate body to perform the functions which NABTEB now performs. The process began with the findings of Justice Sogbetun Commission of Enquiry (1978), which was set up in response to public outcry on perceived inefficiency and unchecked leakages of public examinations. This was followed by the Angulu Commission, which was set up as a result of WAEC’s presentation to the House of Representative Committee on Education in 1981 in which WAEC advocated the setting up of other examination boards in Nigeria “to reduce the burden of WAEC”. The third was the Okoro Panel set up in 1989 to review the Angulu Report. The forth was the Professor Akin Osiyale’s Task Force set up in 1991 “to evolve a strategy to reduce the burden of WAEC and bring about greater efficiency in the conduct of public examinations”.</p>

    <p>The National Business and Technical Examinations Board (NABTEB) under Decree 70 of 1993, and other examinations bodies were thus established. Since its establishment, the findings of the Etsu Nupe Panel (1997), the Shonekan Vision 2010 (1997) Report, and the harmonized Report of the Etsu Nupe Panel and Vision 2010 reports have supported, directly and indirectly, NABTEB’s existence. The National headquarters of the Board is located at Ikpoba Hill, P. M. B. 1747, Benin City, and Edo State.</p>

    <h2>GCE</h2>
    <p>The O-Level (Ordinary Level) is a subject-based qualification conferred as part of the General Certificate of Education. It began in the United Kingdom and has been adopted, often with modifications, in several other countries.</p>
    <p>The GCE O-Level qualification originated in the United Kingdom, where it was awarded as the secondary school-leaving qualification. It was primarily an examinations-based qualification, with a grading system that changed over the years. In the United Kingdom, the O-Level qualifications were replaced in 1988 with the General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE) and the International General Certificate of Secondary Education (IGCSE).</p>
